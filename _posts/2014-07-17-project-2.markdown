description: In this project, I deepened my understanding of GitHub's collaboration features. I explored pull and push operations, learning how to share my code and updates with others. I worked on branches in GitHub to manage different features or fixes separately. I also demonstrated the GitHub Flow, a workflow that helps streamline collaboration. This project enhanced my skills for working effectively with others on coding projects using GitHub.
