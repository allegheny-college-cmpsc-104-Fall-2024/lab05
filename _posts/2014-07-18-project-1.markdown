description: In this project, I learned how to use Git, a tool for managing and tracking changes in code. I started by installing and setting up Git, then created and managed my own repositories. I practiced adding files, checking their status, and saving changes with commits. I also learned how to create and switch between branches, and merge changes to keep my code organized and up-to-date. This project helped me understand how teams work together on coding projects using Git.
